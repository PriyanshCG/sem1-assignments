    <p>
      Many everyday objects are designed for right-handers — including watches.
      But left-handers can wear special models. We’re telling you which models
      are suitable for left-handers and why they’re unique.
    </p>

    <h2>Do you wear a wristwatch on the left or right?</h2>
    <p>
      Most people wear their watch on the left wrist, since they use their right
      hand for writing or handling objects. For left-handers, however, the reverse
      often makes more sense. A left-handed watch has its crown on the opposite
      side, making it easier to operate.
    </p>

    <h2>Why not just wear it on the right?</h2>
    <p>
      Left-handers who wear right-handed watches might find that the crown digs
      into their wrist or becomes hard to reach. A watch designed for left-handers
      solves that issue entirely.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes a watch the right choice for left-handers?</h2>
    <p>
      Besides the reversed crown position, some watches feature mirrored dial
      designs or even reverse movement configurations. The best left-handed watches
      combine practicality with aesthetic appeal, ensuring the same high-end
      craftsmanship as traditional models.
    </p>

    <h2>The History of Left-Handed Watches</h2>
    <p>
      Few know that left-handed watches date back to the mid-20th century, when
      tool watches for divers and pilots were modified to suit southpaws. Brands
      like Tudor and Panerai were among the first to experiment with reversed
      crowns.
    </p>

    <h2>What does “Destro” mean?</h2>
    <p>
      “Destro,” meaning “right” in Italian, is the nickname often given to
      left-handed watches. These “Destro” models were initially made for left-handed
      divers and soldiers. Today, they are a statement of individuality and style.
    </p>

    <h2>Top Models for Left-Handers</h2>
    <p>
      Brands such as Tudor, IWC, and Rolex offer stunning left-handed versions of
      their most famous watches. From the Tudor Pelagos LHD to Rolex’s rare
      left-crown prototypes, these timepieces have become collector favorites.

    <h2>How much does a wristwatch for left-handers cost?</h2>
    <p>
      Like any other timepiece, the price depends on the brand, materials, and
      complexity of the watch. Entry-level models start under $1,000, while luxury
      editions from Rolex or IWC can exceed $10,000.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Left-handed watches are a testament to inclusivity in design. They blend
      ergonomic function with mechanical excellence, showing that even the
      smallest detail — like crown placement — can make a world of difference.
