    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
<p>The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b><br>
such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the <br>
<u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept <br>
of a programmable computer</strong>.</p>

<h2>Generations of Computers </h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has <br>
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.<br>
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, <br>
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.<br>
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal <br>
and affordable</em>.</p>
<p>Mathematics in Computing <br>
A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup><br>
Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.</p>

<h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by <br>
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:<br>
<blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. <br>
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
   â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite> <br>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Modern Era </h2>
<p>Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and <br>
fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
<small>pockets as smartphones</small>.</p>

<h2>Computer Example </h2>
<p>To display text on a webpage, you can use: 
<pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text. <br>
System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
